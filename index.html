         <p>LOS ANGELES (AP) — LeBron James scored his 39,000th point on the way to 17 points, nine assists and seven rebounds,
         and the Los Angeles Lakers completed an unbeaten run through group play in the NBA In-Season Tournament with a 131-99 
         victory over the Utah Jazz on Tuesday night.<br><br>Anthony Davis had 26 points and 16 rebounds for the Lakers, who will host a quarterfinal game early next month to begin the knockout stages of the league’s first in-season tournament. Los Angeles beat Phoenix, Memphis, Portland and Utah by a combined 74 points, 
         capped by this blowout of the Jazz for the Lakers’ sixth victory in seven games overall. <br><br>Already the top scorer in NBA history after passing Kareem Abdul-Jabbar 
         (38,387 points) last season, the 38-year-old James became the first player in league history to top 39,000 points early in the first quarter.<br> <br>
         “I got congratulated by my teammates and coaches, (but) I haven’t had an opportunity to really wrap my head around what that means,” James said. “There’s been so many great players that came across this 
         league since the beginning of time, and so many great scorers. To be able to accomplish something that’s the first of anything, I think that’s always pretty cool. 
         It’s a wild moment, that’s for sure.” </p>

        <div class="paragraph2">
          <p> The NBA’s first In-Season Tournament is new. Its quarterfinal matchups are anything but
           Not that there’s anything wrong with that. A little built-in rivalry can add context to these asterisked 2023-24 regular season games. 
            It’s merely a quirk of Group Play that the Knockout Rounds pairings all have been seen at least once in the first five-plus weeks.<Br><br>
            
            Now these teams will face each other five times by mid-April. Five or more meetings in a season hasn’t happened since the league expanded to 29 teams in 1995-96.
             (It’s still a far cry from the days of Wilt Chamberlain and Bill Russell butting heads 12 times each season in the early 1960s). </p>

        <div class="paragraph3">
          <p> Adding flavor to the Battles for Las Vegas — where the Tournament semifinals and championship game will be held — are individual stars. Four of the league’s Top 10 scorers have reached the quarterfinals: Kevin Durant (31.3 ppg, No. 2), De’Aaron Fox (30.7, No. 4), Giannis Antetokounmpo (30.1, No. 6) and Jayson Tatum (27.7, No. 10). The bracket also boasts the leading assists man, Indiana’s Tyrese Haliburton (11.9), and the third-leading rebounder, Sacramento’s Domantas Sabonis (11.6).
